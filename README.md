# An-Empirical-Investigation-of-Data-Breaches-in-the-Healthcare-Sector

## 📌 Project Description
This project is an honors thesis that analyzes healthcare data breaches in the United States using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. It investigates what types of breaches occur, how they happen, where they occur, and how they are trending over time, with a specific focus on U.S. healthcare organizations.

Using publicly available data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) Breach Portal and insights from reports like the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), the project explores breach types, impacted systems, geographic patterns, and time-based trends. It also proposes mitigation strategies involving policy, governance, insider threat management, and emerging technologies like AI and biometrics.

This work bridges healthcare, cybersecurity, and data analytics, highlighting how data-driven insights can guide better security decisions in a highly regulated industry.

## 🎯 Objectives / Goals
- Analyze patterns and trends in U.S. healthcare data breaches over time.
- Identify the most common types of breaches (e.g., hacking/IT incidents, unauthorized access, theft, loss).
- Determine the most frequently compromised sources of breached information (e.g., network servers, email, paper/film).
- Examine state-by-state impacts, including which states have the highest number of incidents and individuals affected.
- Explore the relationship between breach frequency and total individuals affected.
- Forecast future breach trends using historical incident and impact data.
- Recommend mitigation strategies for healthcare organizations to improve data protection, governance, and resilience.

- **Kaggle**: supplemental dataset exploration and verification
- **Academic research tools**: Google Scholar, university library databases

## 📐 Methodology
This project uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative interpretation of cybersecurity literature and industry reports. OCR breach data (2009–2024) was collected, cleaned, and transformed using Power BI and Excel, then visualized and analyzed in Tableau to uncover patterns in breach type, location, impact, and time trends.

Descriptive statistics, grouping, and calculated fields were used to categorize breach types and locations, while time-series graphs and forecasting functions were applied to model and predict breach trends. Qualitative insights from sources like the Verizon DBIR and peer-reviewed research were integrated to interpret numerical patterns, understand human and organizational factors, and propose mitigation strategies tailored to the healthcare sector.


## 📊 Outcomes / Results
- Analyzed 5,800+ U.S. healthcare data breaches (2010–2024) from the OCR Breach Portal, revealing major trends in breach types, locations, and impacted individuals.
- Determined that Hacking/IT incidents were the dominant breach type, accounting for the largest share of both total incidents and individuals affected nationwide.
- Identified network servers and email as the most frequently compromised locations, together representing the majority of breach sources across the healthcare sector.
- Found a 147% increase in healthcare breach incidents since 2018, with forecasting models projecting continued breach growth through 2026 if current trends persist.
- Conducted state-level correlation analysis, identifying highlighted geographic disparities, with certain states (e.g., Indiana, California, Texas, New York, Florida) showing either very high incident counts, high individual impact, or both.
- Discovered that some states experienced fewer breaches but extremely high-severity incidents, significantly influencing national totals of individuals affected.
- Observed a strong positive correlation between the number of breach events in a state and the total individuals affected, indicating systemic relationships between frequency and severity.
- Highlighted increasing risks to EHR systems and network infrastructure, with IT-related incidents making up a substantial portion of high-impact breaches.
- Integrated findings with cybersecurity literature (e.g., DBIR), reinforcing that human error, insider threats, and organizational practices remain critical contributors to healthcare breach exposure.
- Delivered data-driven mitigation strategies focusing on network security, employee training, insider threat programs, biometric and AI-based security controls, regulatory compliance, and stronger policy/governance frameworks.
